## Project Overview
The Media Search Application allows users to search for images and audio with open licenses by integrating with the [Openverse API](https://api.openverse.org/). The project includes advanced search features, user account management, search history tracking, and the ability to save media items. Additionally, an admin panel is provided for managing admin and user accounts.

## Features
- **Advanced Search:**  
  - Search for images and audio using keywords.
  - Filter results by creator, date range, and license type.
- **User Account Management:**  
  - Registration and login for users.
  - Persistent search history display and deletion.
  - Save and unsave media items.
- **Admin Panel:**  
  - Admin registration and login.
  - Dashboard with statistics (users, admins, saved items).
  - CRUD operations for managing admin and user accounts.
  - View all saved items with associated usernames.
- **Modular & Scalable Architecture:**  
  - Separation of concerns via MVC-like structure (config, controllers, models, services, and public).
- **Containerization:**  
  - Dockerized environment with a single image hosting PHP/Apache.
  - Docker Compose orchestrates the web server, MySQL database, and phpMyAdmin.
- **Automated Build & Testing:**  
  - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml enable automated builds.
  - PHPUnit (via the tests service) is configured for automated testing.
- **Clean Code & Documentation:**  
  - Well-structured code with clear documentation.
  - Error handling and logging in place.

## Project Requirements
The application meets the following requirements:
- **Comprehensive Software Engineering Practices:**
  - Modular architecture using established design patterns and OOP (to be further refactored).
  - Containerization with Docker and Docker Compose.
  - Automated build and testing strategy using CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions, PHPUnit).
  - Clean, well-documented code with separation of configuration, business logic, and presentation.
- **Efficient API Integration:**
  - Integration with the Openverse API to fetch open-license media.
  - Robust token management for API authentication.
- **User and Admin Functionality:**
  - Full user registration, login, search history, and saved items functionality.
  - Admin authentication with CRUD operations for both admin and user management.
- **UI/UX:**
  - Responsive design using Bootstrap.
  - Consistent image display and a modular sidebar for navigation.

```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system.
- (Optional) A local MySQL instance if you choose not to use the Dockerized database.

### Steps to Run the Application
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Update Configuration:**
   - In `backend/config/config.php`, ensure the following constants match your environment:
     ```php
     define('DB_HOST', 'db'); // Use the Docker service name
     define('DB_USER', 'root');
     define('DB_PASS', 'root');   // No password
     define('DB_NAME', 'openverse');
     define('CSRF_TOKEN_NAME', 'csrf_token');
     ```
   
3. **Build and Run Containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
   - The web container will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
   - MySQL is exposed on port 3307, and you can access phpMyAdmin at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).


## Usage
- **Users:**
  - Register, login, search media, view search history, and save items.
- **Admins:**
  - Access the admin dashboard via `backend/public/index.php`.
  - Manage admin accounts (CRUD), manage users, view search history, and view saved items.
- **Dashboard:**
  - Displays statistics such as total users, admin accounts, and saved items.
- **Navigation:**
  - The sidebar provides quick links to Dashboard, Admins, Users, Search History, and Saved Items.

## API Integration
- The application uses the Openverse API to search for open-license media.
- The API token is managed via a dedicated function in your code.
- Search parameters include query, media type, creator, and date filters.

## Automated Testing
- **PHPUnit** is set up in the `tests/` directory (if implemented).
- To run tests, use:
  ```bash
  docker-compose run tests
  ```
- The CI/CD pipeline (if configured via GitHub Actions) runs tests automatically on each commit.

## Deployment
- The application is containerized using Docker.
- Use the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for deployment.
- For production, adjust environment variables and consider additional security measures.
